# Given the following values:

x = 5
y = 10
z = 0
word1 = "hello"
word2 = "world"

# 1. Check if x is less than y and y is greater than z.

print(x < y and y > z) # True

# 2. Verify if word1 is not equal to word2.

print(word1 != word2) # True

# 3. Use the bool() function to check the boolean value of z and word1.

print(bool(z)) # False
print(bool(word1)) # True
