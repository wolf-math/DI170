# Write a function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate the addition and subtraction of it. And also it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call

# For example:

# def calculation(a, b):
#     return (a-b, a+b)

# minus, plus = calculation(40, 10)
# print(minus, plus)

# print(calculation)
